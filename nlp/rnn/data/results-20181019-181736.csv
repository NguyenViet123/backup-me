The most striking finding was that expertise is characterized mostly by a reduction of human resource usage (both physical and cognitive). 

One interesting finding dealt with the game of Tetris: expert players move/rotate far more the pieces before dropping them than beginners. The interpretation is that a mental rotation is a arduous task that requires in the order of 300ms, whereas pressing a key to rotate the piece and check the result takes less than 100ms. Hence, in the tradeoff, moving uses less resources than thinking. For this specific situation.

"&gt; The fallout however is a disaster, now any tech company can be as anti competitive as it wants.

It's not quite as bad as that because CAFC opinions on copyright do not set precedent. There are a limited number of subjects for which appeals get sent to CAFC instead of the Nth Circuit Court of Appeals where N is the number of the circuit in which the trial court resides.

In cases that include such subjects, any issues that normally would go to the Nth Circuit also get shunted to CAFC. That's how this copyright issue ended up there. The Oracle case was also a patent case, and patent cases get appealed to CAFC instead of the Nth Circuit, and so the copyright issues also went there.

In such cases, CAFC is supposed to follow the precedent of the Nth Circuit for those accompanying issues, and future trial courts in that circuit will continue to follow the Nth Circuit Court of Appeals.

It's still somewhat of a problem because copyright suits that are also patent suits will go to CAFC (even if only copyright issues are appealed).

This could be fixed with a simple change to the law. Congress could change it so that when a case has both issues that always go to CAFC, and issues that only go to CAFC by accompanying issues in the first group, the latter issues go to the Nth Circuit Court of Appeals like they normally would.

At the trial court stage, it makes sense to have one court deal with all the issues between the parties in a particular matter because the trial court is the fact finder. If each issue was tried separately, many witnesses would have to testify at multiple trials, and many facts would be relevant to multiple issues. It would inefficient and unduly burdensome on the parties.

These considerations do not apply on appeal. The appeals court accepts the trial court findings of fact, and is only concerned with determining and applying the law to those facts and with whether or not the trial court followed the law correctly when determining the facts (e.g., correctly applied the rules of evidence when deciding what was admissible).

This does not involve witnesses or a jury. It is just the appeals court judge (or judges), the records from the trial court, and lawyers reprenteng the parties.

It would not be unduly burdensome in cases like this to unbundle the issues and send the patent issues to CAFC and the copyright issues to the Nth Circuit.

"My response may be considered subjective, but I will respond regardless.

When I said ""Rigging the entire process"" what I meant was ""Rigging the entire primary process by leveraging her knowledge and position to create a primary that was very in her favor institutionally"". 

Now if you look at the system itself, it was and still is in her favor. She could have done nothing and still have been pretty comfortable.

What I'm saying she did was lock down super delegate support, and plant people in the DNC in just the right way to make competition inordinately difficult. DWS is factually a Clinton Plant. Arguments about whether anyone else prominent is working in her favor are for the most part irrelevant since DWS has the most important role in the organization and the power to control/remove dissenters.

I do understand that Bernie is not a democrat, and so a lot of people have not and cannot endorse him because of this. This does not however explain how they continue to ignore the rest of the candidates. Or act like the points being raised are easily ignored. Regardless of what you think about O'Malley, a fair and democratic party based on merit and inclusiveness should at the very least acknowledge what is being said in a fair manner. What we are getting instead is blockaded. DWS's actions are autocratic and no one who wants progress or fair politics can support her or her actions.

Since it is clear that DWS is only at her position due to her connection to Clinton, Clinton cannot be innocent of forcing the DNC into an uncomfortable position, and one that benefits Clinton entirely.

Now it may not be true that super delegates are being told to toe the line by the party leadership, but it is not a difficult assumption to make as it already happens in a weekly basis on both sides. Clinton as the establishment candidate could and would use whatever leverage she has to make the race as easy as possible for herself (she'd be a terrible politician otherwise).

All that I'm saying is that there is a real desire for non-establishment approaches to problems in this country (on both sides). DWS's insistence on the debate schedule is effectively censorship, since the only thing that could damage Hillary more than the email nonsense is an actual discussion on what the problems are with this country(as happened to her in 2008). If the process wasn't rigged, more debates would be a non issue, since not only would more debates be relatively easy to arrange, but there wouldn't have been an artificially low limit of debates to begin with. The DNC should want the candidate with the best views and approaches to succeed and not only would more debates provide a platform for that but it would boost interest in that best candidate nationally. This is not something a DNC free of manipulation should fear.

"I use this script when I deal with family/friends/colleagues who express similar views. First: Realize that you can't argue facts with a person who came to their conclusions from emotions and supported by bullshit mountain news. Reason does not work.

So before you start, the important thing to remember is that your goal is to get them to move slightly away from their source of facts, out of the spot that their emotions tells them is comfortable. That's very tough.

Ok? So here's the process:

1. Ask them what they use for their source of news (FOX).

2. Ask them how they can trust a source of news that repeatedly does things like take a video showing a person saying one thing and edit the video to make it appear as if they said the exact OPPOSITE. Essentially taking ""No I didn't"" and cutting it to say ""I did""

If they are sane/rational they will respond with something like ""I can't believe they would ever do that.""

3 . Then, and this is the key part, sit down with them and show them this video: http://mediamatters.org/research/200905010049 . And then focus on ""this is bad right?"" ""Pretty clear, right""

Points: They might comment that this is from media matters, just say that the original video is from CSPAN and FOX, all you/mediamatters are doing is playing them side by side.

The fact that it is for a source the CSPAN uncut tape and the fox uncut tape make a HUGE impact.
You can get through the ""oh the liberal media"" stuff but just saying ""this is just uncut raw video"" you can make your own judgment.

The response after the video has always been a mental gear shift, and if that's all it takes then you can start the process of discussions. But until
you break that emotional hideout they will keep listening to fox/limbaugh with a trusting ear. You have to train them to not trust FOX.

4 . In some cases they come back with the talking point ""Oh this is just O'Reily - I just watch him for fun, not the facts, you can't find this in the news section."" Again once they've said this - you still have a chance of talking to them because you've now popped their info bubble. And if they do come back with that talking point, then I show them this http://mediamatters.org/blog/201101030036

"I think this is pretty clever, but realistically shouldn't be allowed -- (buzzkill, I know). My reasoning is that what happens if there really is something with the ball?

The ball probably did a little turn on the catwalk.,51
"Various ways, I left it out of the first explanation because it requires a bit more background on the layout of the pitch and how the game is played.  
  
Most of the mechanics of cricket revolve around the ""pitch"": unintuitively the pitch does not mean the entire area of play (the field), it only refers to a small rectangular strip of very hard, compressed ground right in the middle. The pitch measures 22 yards in length, and 10 feet in width.  
At either end of the pitch is a wicket (I know, same name, it's cricket, just roll with it) which [looks like this](http://www.ifbcc.co.uk/wp-content/themes/twentyten/images/2011%2005%2029_1561_edited-1.jpg).  
  
So when cricket is played by kids in the park, its often just done with 1 wicket and 1 batsman. The batsman stands in front of the wicket with his bat, and the bowler runs towards him and throws the ball. The Bowler is trying to hit the wicket, and the batsman tries to hit the ball away. This is the fundamental of cricket.  
  
In the full game this is still the core of it: but the extra wicket and extra batsman adds some structure. I'll try to explain. The main batsman (who is referred to as being ""On Strike"") stands guard in front of one wicket, looking towards the second wicket. 
The bowler starts out standing behind the second wicket (the distance is his preference) and starts to run towards the pitch. When he arrives [this is the scene](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/69/Muralitharan_bowling_to_Adam_Gilchrist.jpg). Here the batsman (yellow) on the right of the picture is On Strike, and facing a ball that has just been bowled. The Bowler has just finished his run-up and bowled the ball.  
There are various restrictions on how the bowler bowls the ball, but the 2 main ones are: his arm must arc over his head and be completely straight until he lets go (no throwing), and his foot must be behind that white line when he lets go. Also be aware: because the bowler is releasing the ball above his head it is usual to aim for it to ""pitch"" (bounce) a couple of yards in front of the batsman. There's a lot of strategy in where the ball pitches and what happens when it does.  
  
So what happens next?  
If everything goes the batsman's way he'll hit the ball, and then they start running. This is why there are 2 batsman. They exchange ends, several times; every time they successfully make it to the other end they score 1 ""run"". While this is happening a fielder is chasing the ball down, and then throws it back to one of the wickets.  
  
--------------------------  
**So how do the fielding/bowling team get a batsman ""out""?**  
1) The bowler bowls the ball, the batsman misses it, and it hit the wicket directly. **Bowled**  
2) The batsman hits it up in the air, and someone catches it. **Caught**  
3) The batsman prevents the ball from hitting the wicket with his body. This is called **LBW** (Leg Before Wicket) and is very complicated, but the point is that the batsman is meant to use his bat, not his arse to block it.  
4) **Stumped** or **Runout** - technically different but mechanically the same.  
Remember that white line that the bowler's foot must be behind? Go check that image again, you'll see that his front foot is juuust behind one of the lines. You'll also notice that the non-strike batsman is taking care to keep his bat behind that line as well. That line is called the ""Crease"", and it marks the edge of the batsmens' safe zones (there is one in front of both wickets, the area in between is the danger zone). As long as any part of the batsman (including bat) is touching the ground Inside the crease he is safe from being run-out.  
To run a batsman out the fielding team must hit the wicket with the ball when the batsman is outside his crease. So...  
Runout = the batsman hit it, and they are now running, but they got greedy and went for 1 too many runs. The fielder throws the ball in to a teammate who's taken up position next to one of the wickets, and that fielder hits the wicket with the ball while the batsman was outside the crease. Run Out.  
Stumped = mechanically the same thing, but imagine the bowler bowls the ball and the extra-confident batsman takes a couple of steps down the pitch towards him, planning on smacking the ball extra hard before it bounces. Buuuut he misses. Notice that fielder squatting down behind him, very close to the wicket? He's the wicket keeper (think BackStop). He's there to stop the ball from flying off into the outfield if the batsman misses it and it also misses the wicket. But he's also there to get wickets (the other kind... the ""out"" kind). The Wicket Keeper get's wickets 2 ways: 1) batsman 'nicks' the ball with the edge of his bat, it goes up in the air, and the keeper catches it. 2) The scenario described above: batsman is out of his crease when the ball reaches the wicket keeper, who breaks the wicket.  
5) *(credit to /u/nativeunicorn for pointing out I missed it)* The batsman must not hit the ball twice, or hit it after it's hit his body. If he does he's out: **Double Hit**. The only exception is for the sole purpose of defending the wicket, e.g. he tries to just tap the ball away, but miss-hits it a bit and it's rolling towards the wicket: in this case he's allowed to put his bat down in front of it to stop it.  
6) /u/daveonhols reminded me of a big one that I shouldn't have missed: if the batsman hits the wicket with his backswing then that's also out **Hit Wicket**: a punishment for a clumsy fuck-up really, but without it the batsman could knock down his own wicket before the ball did.
  
When a batsman is out he returns to the pavilion and another comes out to replace him.  
Be aware - when I was talking about a batsman being ""On Strike"" that's not like a primary and secondary batsman, they swap ends a lot. And the bowler also swaps end every 6 balls. So both batsmen get plenty of time on strike, although there's actually strategy around that. Your team is only 11 people, and so some are good bowlers, and some are good batsman, but it's rare for 1 person to be great at both. So when batting you'll often end up with a great batsman who's stayed in for hours, but all of his partners keep getting out so now he's paired with a guy who's a great bowler but a poor batsman. In this case the 2 batsman will do their best to only swap ends an even number of times, so that the good batsman stays on Strike. Then on the 5th or 6th bowl they'll try to swap so that when the bowler swaps he's again facing the good batsman.  
There's always 1 batsman left ""not-out"" at the end (run out of partners), and it's sometimes the guy who was first in at the start of the day (but not often; it's easy to slip up and get punished).
  
*TLDR: Bowled, Caught, LWB, RunOut, Hit Wicket, Double Hit, and some cases for strange thing like handling the ball or otherwise being a bit of a dick about it.

"I know this comment might come with a ""duh"" factor, but each one of her fights, other than the last one, has had a moment that she capitalizes on quickly in the fights. I don't think we have actually seen what she is made of. 

Example, I know how to do a arm bar and I have a little bit (not a lot) of jujitsu talent, so I could be in there with someone that can beat the shit out of me, and an opportunity for a arm bar arises and I jump on it.

"It's such a bad argument to get caught up in. What people don't want to realize (I'm 30 by the way) is that my generation just barely caught a glimpse of Jordan. What we remember is mostly his ""greatest hits."" His buzzer beaters over the Jazz and Cavs. Him winning despite a crazy fever (which many say is actually him fighting a hangover). We don't see the game winners he missed. We don't see his 5-20 shooting nights. We only remember the highlight clips. Jordan never had to deal with social media. He didn't have to deal with vines of him putting up bricks to lose a game. He never had to deal with social media lashing out at him for cheating on his wife, and having a gambling problem, or him being a drunk. Can you imagine what would have happened on social media if it were around when Jordan played? The rumors about his involvement with his father's death? Him apparently being asked to take a year off (his baseball year) because of his gambling problem?

Again I hate comparing the two, because it's an argument you'll never win as a LeBron supporter. I don't claim to think he's better than Jordan. He's got a ways to go, but it's hilarious to me when people won't even entertain the fact that he belongs in the conversation.",1239

"You have to understand that football has a pace, it doesn't stop every 30 seconds, like American football to review videos and whatnot. So every decision has to be made by the referee, on the fly, by what him and his assistants are able to watch. Since players are usually running at quite high speeds while trying to control the ball with their feets, touches from the other player, even though not very strong is enough to disrupt the other player and make him lose control of the player. The referee by the limited view (though not so bad, depending on his positioning) can't always catch that, so the player has to ""show"" him what happened. 

Sure exaggerations, like in this gif, and exploitations do happen, but you also have to take into consideration that like any competitive sport players are very good at hitting and disrupting their opponents in a concealed way. It's very common, for example to just slightly extend your arm into your opponent's face, which is case for instant red, if the referee manages to catch it. While what happens in this gif is totally innocent, it isn't always the case, so it could be that he is trying to take advantage of the situation, or he could really believe that the other player wanted to hit him in the face, and if that was the case, it doesn't matter how hard it is, intentionally elbowing someone is anti sportsmanship behaviour.

Anyways, while some cases of clear diving is usually directly punished during the game, the referees also take note about players that like to dive, and in the long run they are being severe punished because the ref will tend to think he is just acting.",1637

2) The player can't take the game with them, and they have to wait their turn to play, so there's no way you could charge a one time fee of $60 or whatever for unlimited lifetime play. Nobody would pay it. Plus, some people will visit the arcade every day, and some will visit once a year. A flat fee just doesn't work for an arcade.  
  
3) The arcade owner is paying for electricity / floorspace / hardware maintenance. They need to continue to make more money from the game every month to pay these costs. The company that made your mobile game isn't paying any of those costs, you pay them yourself.  
  
Some mobile game companies may use the arcade analogy to justify these microtransactions, but the fact is that it's an apples to oranges comparison. Tablets / phones are not arcades, and the situation that made the insert another quarter model ideal for arcades is not the same on any home / personally owned system.",1319

"No, it's definitely the game. The core experience is not the same as vanilla wow, or even wow up to...Wraith. We'll say wraith. The experience of finding a 5 man dungeon, grouping, working together to figure it out is gone. Insta queueing half killed it, but the power creep of player builds murdered it. You can solo tank/dps all those low level dungeons as a shadow priest if you want. So all the fun of exploring low level content, then battling through the dungeon at the end of the area is crushed. the gear is useless. No one cares. Just grind past it.

Leveling is a joke. Some people played for the experience of the low level zones, the gathering of weird loot, the fun of grouping up in world pvp, the collecting of low level goods in a a busy, nasty pvp zone. They didn't get into raiding but low level community and dungeons and fun was where it was at. The game is empty and crushed for those people as you can auto token level to end game, and leapfrog level through easy content in either case.

Talent builds are non existent. Whatever uniqueness you use to feel, whatever joy you use to get out of trying a different 5% here or a funky talent in another tree there is crushed. How boring.

I was never hard, hard core into end game raids. But I respected the investment. I had a couple small guilds that would try some 10/15 mans from time to time. It was hard. It was once a week, and it was work. But there was a payout at the end. That attracted a ton of people. The hard 40 man stuff is gone, the gear is watered down, and there are tons of ways to get comparable gear easily. The end game is crushed.

What we need to get going is political leadership to start taking real action to help the less fortunate parts of our society and not just with handouts.  We need to educate these people and create jobs and update our infrastructure to cater to this.

Heres an idea: tell the teacher unions to fuck off and that were overhauling the public education system in america.  Boys and girls are sperated to create less distraction (and they can socialize at times throughout the day like lunch time and recess and after school) while teaching is more automated so that each ""teacher"" provides the best explinations for various topics (and make the presentations fun and entertaining, why the fuck not).  Then for students that need more help even after listening/watching the best presenters we can find and deliver to them on say a virtual reality headset for each student, real in person teachers could exist to give them extra help when needed. - You want to help the people, then brainstorm and take action and actually help them.  You know, leadership.  Something this country used to have.",1668

"I live in Whistler, BC. (A mountain ski town in Canada) We do not have chameleons here.  I removed the tarp from my bike, and saw this guy. After the initial shock wore off, I took a picture and posted it to a local Facebook group for lost and found and local news.  I've never cared for a lizard before, so I sought advice from people commenting on the post.  We brought him in, put him in a cooler with a towel, water, and some kale.  Then we put a lamp beside him to warm him up.  It was pretty cool this morning, about 13c.  After about an hour, there was a knock on the door.  It was the owner, who had seen the post about where to come get him.  He had been missing for 4 days.  He lives in my building, three floors up, and a few units over. It was really cold and rainy the last few days, so he had feared the worst.  Luckily, Joffrey had found refuge under the tarp.

"In all likelihood the currency is 100% dead. Hyperinflation is not something fiat money recovers from. The issue isn't the simple worth it's the quantity in circulation.

 I don't know the specific situation for Venezuela but typically hyperinflation is triggered by government deficit. Being a very socialist government, im sure they could not raise enough revenue from taxes and the nationalized oil industry to pay for the broad set of social programs. To cover the deficit they printed more money. When the quantity goes up the bs. necessary went down in value. As the bs. loses value the government has to print even more reducing the value a lot more. (Btw the U.S. has a similar deficit fiat system. But don't worry U.S. politicians are different and totally competent;)

"Oddly enough that nonsensical dichotomy shows up a lot. Pat Robertson, a prominent american baptist minister, absolutely condemns homosexually but doesn't believe there is any sin in transitioning from one gender to the other. 

Even within the american gay community there is serious fracture. It tends to be reflective of the american public as a whole but more polarized. 

Within the gay men's community trans people are viewed as nothing more than ""crazy queens"". Trans women and drag queens do not get along, often due to drags queen propensity to use slurs like ""tranny"" and ""shemale"" and tendency to proclaim themselves as ""experts"" on gender. This coupled with drag queens having a much higher visibility in society (due to their more flamboyant manners) than transgender people causes many people to mistake drag queens and trans women to be the same thing even though they are two separate communities whos entire existences tend to be a odds to one another.

Within the lesbian community (Where trans women who are actually involved in gay society tend to actually be) the issues are more silent. You can still find women in the community who are verbosely opposed to trans women in women's spaces (i.e. Cathy Brennan, though she seems to have faded from public view recently). It tends to be more of simply not changing old rules about attendance (women-born-women is a rule that is very old and very common within lesbian communities). Michfest, a women-only music festival, recently announced it would simply close its doors forever after years of backlash over it policy rather than change its WBW rule. Even outside the lesbian community access to women's spaces are barred to trans women based on ""assigned birth sex"".

I only speak for trans women because that's my experience, i don't know much about trans mens' interactions with the gay community.",1869

Edit: I'm American so I know the troubles, insurance is very much a scam, the insurance is built around legislative demand, that money which is invested by the companies to further profit off of. 
That money could go to subsidize whatever branch that insurance covers (or kept for the individual to invest in whatever they see fit), but is rather used to make wealthy companies who lobby to keep their demand in legislate. 

The car insurance tidbit works with clunkers or cheap cars but high premiums often times can grow past the initial cost of the car or further restrain the ability (financially) to buy a better car. Its all a sham.

Edit2: If you use medical insurance included into car insurance as a reason for high rates you are very much baited, Americans paying into medical insurance and the entire medical system could have free health care.
